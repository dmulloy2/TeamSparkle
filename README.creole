**Sick of the immense lag that mcMMO causes? Sick of the exploits and general nonchalant nature of the mcMMO-Dev team? You've come to the right place!

**Introducing SwornRPG, the fully featured (and much less laggy and exploitable) alternative to mcMMO! SwornRPG is based upon a very simplistic leveling system, where daily tasks, like farming, fighting players and mobs, enchanting, taming, and being on the server, contribute experience to one single experience pool. As with any good leveling system, SwornRPG awards players with diamonds and cash (both configurable) every time they amass enough xp to level up! Players also receive increased ability times and greater chances for many of SwornRPG's extra features! Players can check their xp and level using /level and check the leaderboard with /srpg top. This plugin also has many, many other features that would not fit on this page!

**Thanks for over 3,500 downloads!!!**

==Salvaging
This plugin allows for the salvaging of used armor. Salvaging the used armor gives the player SOME of the ingots back, but it is designed to be inefficient. For example: If you salvage a full set of unused diamond armor, you will only get 20 diamonds back (using the config defaults). If the armor is used, the plugin calculates how many ingots the player should receive based on what you defined in the configuration.
